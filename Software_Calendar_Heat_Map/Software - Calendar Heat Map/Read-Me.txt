The Calendar Heat Map - VizGenie
This visualization is still in development and not yet implemented on VizGenie.

Requirements:
- Node js (14.7)
- Python3

Content of this folder:
- calendar_visualization.html
- calendar_visualization_per_year_version.html
- edited_enron_dataset.csv

Extensions needed:
- D3 library

Explanation of content:
The first HTML file (calendar_visualization.html) is a version of the Calendar Heat Map program 
which works but does not print to the desired layout (printing months by year).

The second HTML file (calendar_visualization_per_year_version.html) is the latest version of the Calendar Heat Map program 
which does not run and hence does not work yet, but it is programmed with the aim to print the months by year. 
The aim is to develop this program further in the future and to get the widgets of the other visualizations workig with this visualization too.

The CSV-file (edited_enron_dataset.csv) is an edited version of the original enron_1 dataset. 
This CSV-file contains the data in the correct format that is needed for this program to be able to run.
We have obtained this edited version of the original Enron CSV dataset by taking the following steps:

Conversion steps
1.	Convert text to columns (data)
2.	Extend width dates column
3.	Sort by date (Home  sort oldest to newest)
4.	Select and replace all decimal points with commas in sentiment column
5.	Add date column
6.	Add average sentiment (= count) column
7.	Use =SUMIF($A$2:$A$31042; F2 ;$D$2:$D$31042) to get the Sum of sentiment ordered by day (the $ is used to use a fixed range) 
8.	Add value column to data and set every row to 1
9.	Use =SUMIFS() to sum the number of inputs by using value
10.	Divide the sum of sentiment by this number to obtain the average sentiment per day: using =IF(J2;I2/J2;0) (the if statement prevents occurring errors when dividing by 0)
11.	Change date-format CTRL 1  change date format to year-month-day

The aim is to develop a Python script as we did for the other two visualizations to automatically create a new CSV-file from the uploaded CSV-file by the user of VizGenie.
